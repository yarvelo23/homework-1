# Homework-1: HTML Code Refactor 

The main objective of this project was to amend existing code for Horiseon's web page in order to meet accessibility standards.  In addition to this, the ultimate goal was to adjust the code so that it was both semantically and stylistically improved over the original.  

The first step was to become familiar with the HTML-5 semantic and accessibility standards as referenced on http://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.pdf. This allowed familiarization with the html element flow chart and how each element can be improved with the use of semantic tags. 

Next step was to review the original html code for Horiseon's web page.  The elements were reviewed in sequential order to determine if there were semantic attributes applied.  Elements lacking semantic attributes were amended with the appropriate semantic tag.  All changes were noted as html comments.  

Lastly, the corresponding css style sheet was adjusted to change class, id, tag referencing where needed.
